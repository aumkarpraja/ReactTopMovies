# React Top Movies

This is essentially my first stab at React, there may be a few weird details here and there but this was my "fixed time" 4 or so hour attempt at creating a basic React web app. It makes use of the latest version of Material UI (4.9) and the latest version of React at this time. Some styling work is still pending but I'll make it look pretty real soon!

## Running the application

1. cd into the root directory of this project
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm start`.
4. Access application via `http://localhost:3000`
