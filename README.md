# React Top Movies

This is essentially my first stab at React, there may be a few weird details here and there but this was my "fixed time" 4 or so hour attempt at creating a basic React web app. It makes use of the latest version of Material UI (4.9) and the latest version of React at this time. Some styling work is still pending but I'll make it look pretty real soon!

## Running the application

Please note that in order to run this application, you will need to generate an API key from the `The Movie Database` site. You can get an API key by creating an account, going into the  settings and clicking the API bar on the left hand side of the account page.

1. cd into the root directory of this project
2. Generate an `apiKey.js` file in the src directory and paste in your key as follows
```
export default '[key here]';
```
3. Run `npm install`.
4. Run `npm start`.
5. Access application via `http://localhost:3000`
